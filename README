README:					this file


-------------------SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS-------------------
Google protocol buffers c binding, 0.15 or later
		http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-c/downloads/list


Google protocol buffers c++ binding, 2.3.0 or later
		http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list


-------------------COMPILE AND INSTALL-------------------
Assuming that Google protocol buffers c and c++ bindings are configured with --prefix=/usr/local while running ./configure

To compile and install:
	make

If you install Google protocol buffers c and c++ bindings to customized directory, e.g./home/tony/Installed/built, make sure to export them, e.g.
export USER_LIB=$USER_LIB:/home/tony/Installed/built/lib
export USER_INCLUDE=$USER_INCLUDE:/home/tony/Installed/built/include

, otherwise the ZHT runtime fails to locate dependencies


-------------------RUN THE BENCHMARK-------------------
To run benchmark:
1. ./zht_server.exe 50000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP
2. ./zht_benchmark.exe 10000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP

NOTE that the startup arguments can not be OUT OF ORDER, e.g. 
	50000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP, for ZHT server, and
	10000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP, for ZHT client,

	are the SEQUENCE expected, CHANGING THE ORDER is likely to lead to ERRORS.

In ./zht_server.exe 50000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP, 
	50000 means ZHT server PORT, 
	neighbor is the file that contains neighbored nodes in DHT overlay network,
	zht.cfg is to config other parameters of ZHT,
	TCP is to use tcp protocol, instead, UDP is used.

In ./zht_benchmark.exe 10000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP
	10000 means running 10000 iterations of ZHT INSERT/LOOKUP/REMOVE/APPEND, 
	neighbor is the file that contains neighbored nodes in DHT overlay network,
	zht.cfg is to config other parameters of ZHT,
	TCP is to use tcp protocol, instead, UDP is used.


-------------------STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT-------------------
To deploy ZHT on a single node,
1. ./zht_server.exe 50000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP
2. ./your_zht_client.exe neighbor zht.cfg TCP

NOTE that your_zht_client.exe is your binary that invokes ZHT client to INSERT/LOOKUP/REMOVE/APPEND key/value pairs.
Similarly, 50000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP or neighbor zht.cfg TCP are SEQUENCE expected, CHANGING THE ORDER is likely to lead to ERRORS.


-------------------CLUSTER DEPLOYMENT-------------------
To deploye ZHT on a cluster of nodes:
1. copy zht binary, that is, zht_server.exe, to every node.
2. copy configure files, that is, neighbor, zht.cfg, to every node.
3. edit the the file neighbor to contain all the ip and port of these nodes, DO NOT USE localhost.
4. In every node, run ./zht_server.exe 50000 neighbor zht.cfg TCP, assuming 50000 is the port configured.
5. run your ZHT applications.


-------------------DEVELOPE YOUR ZHT APPLICATIONS-------------------
To develope your own ZHT applications, please refer TO c_zhtclient_main.c, which extensively tests ZHT client c binding, internally invoking c++ binding.

To compile your own ZHT applications(e.g.your_zht_app.c), we give out the sample Makefile for this purpose, see also sample_Makefile in src/, to save your time.
